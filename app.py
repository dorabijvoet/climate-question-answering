<p><b>Climate change and environmental disruptions have become some of the most pressing challenges facing our planet today</b>. As global temperatures rise and ecosystems suffer, it is essential for individuals to understand the gravity of the situation in order to make informed decisions and advocate for appropriate policy changes.</p>
<p>However, comprehending the vast and complex scientific information can be daunting, as the scientific consensus references, such as <b>the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, span thousands of pages</b> and are often laden with technical jargon.

    How does ClimateGPT work?
</div>
ClimateGPT harnesses modern OCR techniques to parse and preprocess IPCC reports. By leveraging state-of-the-art question-answering algorithms, <i>ClimateGPT is able to sift through the extensive collection of climate scientific reports and identify relevant passages in response to user inquiries</i>. Furthermore, the integration of the ChatGPT API allows ClimateGPT to present complex data in a user-friendly manner, summarizing key points and facilitating communication of climate science to a wider audience. This innovative chatbot effectively puts a climate expert in your pocket, empowering you to engage with crucial environmental issues in a more informed and meaningful way.
