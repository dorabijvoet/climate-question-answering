## üõ¢Ô∏è Carbon Footprint

Carbon emissions were measured during the development and inference process using CodeCarbon [https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon](https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon)

| Phase | Description | Emissions | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Development  | OCR and parsing all pdf documents with AI | 28gCO2e | CodeCarbon |
| Development | Question Answering development | 114gCO2e | CodeCarbon |
| Inference | Question Answering | ~0.102gCO2e / call | CodeCarbon |
| Inference | API call to turbo-GPT | ~0.38gCO2e / call | https://medium.com/@chrispointon/the-carbon-footprint-of-chatgpt-e1bc14e4cc2a |

Carbon Emissions are **relatively low but not negligible** compared to other usages: one question asked to ClimateQ&A is around 0.482gCO2e - equivalent to 2.2m by car (https://datagir.ademe.fr/apps/impact-co2/)

## üíª Developers
For developers, the methodology used is detailed below : 
-¬†Extract individual paragraphs from scientific reports¬†(e.g., IPCC, IPBES) using OCR techniques and open sources algorithms
- Use Haystack to compute semantically representative embeddings for each paragraph using a sentence transformers model (https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1).¬†
- Store all the embeddings in a FAISS Flat index.¬†
- Reformulate each user query to be as specific as possible and compute its embedding.¬†
- Retrieve up to 10 semantically closest paragraphs (using dot product similarity) from all available scientific reports.¬†
- Provide these paragraphs as context for GPT-Turbo's answer in a system message.¬†
