This year, PV data for all countries have been converted to DC (direct current), increasing capacity for countries reporting in AC (alternating current). Conversions are based on an IEA survey of more than 80 countries and interviews with PV industry associations. Solar PV systems work by capturing sunlight using photovoltaic cells and converting it into DC electricity. The DC electricity is then usually converted using an inverter, as most electrical devices and power systems use AC. Until about 2010, AC and DC capacity in most PV systems were similar, but with developments in PV system sizing, these two values may now differ by up to 40%, especially in utility-scale installations.

Upstream and midstream emissions include CO2 and methane emissions occurring during the extraction, processing, and supply of fuels (coal, natural gas) or production, processing, and transport of biomass. Error bars for natural gas and coal represent the impact of the observed range of upstream and midstream emissions today on emissions intensities. For natural gas, the lower bound corresponds to best available technology today (4.5 kg CO2-eq/GJ), and the upper bound to the 95% percentile of the world range (28 kg CO2-eq/GJ). For coal, the lower bound corresponds to the 5% percentile (6 kg CO2-eq/GJ) and the upper bound to the 95% percentile (23 kg CO2-eq/GJ) of global upstream and midstream emissions of coal supply. The 2021 world grid average is based on a generation-weighted global average of the grid electricity intensity, with the error bars representing the 10% percentile (50 g CO2-eq/kWh) and 90% percentile (700 g CO2-eq/kWh) across countries. The grid electricity intensities include direct CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions at the power plants, but not upstream and midstream emissions for the fuels used in the power plants.

These embedded emissions are not included in the IPHE methodology and shown here only for illustrative purposes. Electrolysis refers to low-temperature water electrolysis with an assumed overall electricity demand of 50 kWh/kg H2, including compression to 30 bar.

Performance is measured via arithmetic returns, which refer to the sum of quarterly returns on a given stock (capital gains and dividends).
Weekly financial performance of selected EV, battery and battery mineral and metal companies are plotted against the top 10 carmakers and the broader public equity market benchmark, MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI), at an index level.
All indices except MSCI ACWI and for battery minerals and metals are equal-weighted, giving equal importance to each constituent company regardless of market capitalisation or share.
The EV index consists of 14 pure-play EV companies (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, NIO, Li Auto, XPeng, Fisker, Nikola, Arrival, Proterra, Lion Electric, Hyzon, Canoo, Hyliion) and the battery index of seven battery manufacturing companies (LG Energy Solution, BYD, Contemporary Amperex Technology, Samsung SDI, Gotion High-tech, Eve Energy, Farasis Energy).
The top 10 carmakers include Toyota, Volkswagen, Kia Hyundai, General Motors, Ford, Nissan, Stellantis, Renault, and Mercedes-Benz.

CCUS = carbon capture utilisation and storage. For FCEVs, the red dots show the well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions incurred if hydrogen were to be produced via electrolysis with dedicated renewable sources. The height of the stacked column shows instead total well-to-wheel emissions of fuel cell electric vehicles considering current and projected share of hydrogen production pathways. Therefore, the difference between the red column and the total indicates the theoretical well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions reduction potential of FCEVs. The carbon intensity of global electricity generation improves 26% between 2019 and 2030 STEPS and a further 30% between 2030 APS and 2030 STEPS. The utility factor of PHEVs is assumed to improve by six percentage points between 2019 and 2030 STEPS and by a further nine percentage points between 2030 STEPS and 2030 APS. 2019 STEPS considers a vehicle sold in 2019 with well-to-tank intensities evolving in line with the STEPS trajectory, while 2030 APS considers a vehicle sold in 2030 with the well-to-tank intensities evolving in line with the APS trajectories.",Global Fuel Economy Initiative 2021,https://www.iea.org/reports/global-fuel-economy-initiative-2021

The range indicates the variability of WTW GHG emissions for each powertrain at the country level. For PHEVs, BEVs, and FCEVs, the range is determined considering the minimum and maximum fuel-economy values across countries covered by the Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) (for more on the GFEI, see IEA, 2019c). PHEVs are assumed to drive 60% of their annual mileage on electric drivetrain and 40% on gasoline engine. For PHEVs and BEVs, the carbon intensities of electricity generation at country level are obtained from Energy Technology Perspectives 2020 (IEA, 2020): the minimum and maximum correspond to a vehicle charging in Iceland (0.1 g CO2-eq/kWh) and South Africa (1 002 gCO2-eq/kWh) (2018). For FCEVs, the minimum is calculated considering production of hydrogen from dedicated renewables, the maximum corresponds to hydrogen production from electrolysis considering electrolysis in China (the country with the most FCEVs in operation and with the highest carbon intensity of electricity generation) and the world average is based on steam methane reforming (8.8 kg CO2-eq/kg hydrogen).",,

A weighted average of each contributing factor is derived here based on the number of each model in the total data set. The percentages look at the average absolute standard deviation.

The growth that still occurs in the downside case is due only to increased utilisation of existing infrastructure. The analysis assumes that the proportion of demand that cannot be met with existing regasification capacity in a given country will be lost, and not be met by other supply sources, such as domestic production or pipeline imports.",Gas 2020,https://www.iea.org/reports/gas-2020
